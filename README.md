## **Box Office Revenue Prediction: An Ensemble Learning Approach with Feature Engineering and Comprehensive Evaluation**


## Abstract

Accurately forecasting box office revenue is a challenging task due to the complex interplay of artistic, financial, and audience-driven factors.
This project introduces an **ensemble-based learning framework** that combines **feature engineering** and **rigorous evaluation** to improve predictive accuracy.
Using a dataset of **4,880 films**, multiple machine learning algorithms—Linear, Ridge, Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting—were tested.
The **Gradient Boosting model** achieved the best results, explaining **76.4% of the variance (R² = 0.7639)** in box office revenue.
This repository provides all code, data pipelines, and analysis supporting the study.

## Research Objective

To design and evaluate a **data-driven framework** that can predict movie box office revenue using engineered features and ensemble machine learning models.
The study aims to assist producers, distributors, and marketing professionals in making informed investment and scheduling decisions.

## Methodology

### 1. Dataset Description

* Total movies analyzed: **4,880**
* Features include: `budget`, `revenue`, `vote_count`, `runtime`, `genres`, `release_year`
* Dataset derived by merging metadata and credits files, filtered for quality and completeness.

### 2. Feature Engineering

* **Budget per minute**, **log-transformed features**, **vote-weighted scores**
* **Temporal indicators** such as release year and decade classification
* **Audience engagement metrics**: vote count, popularity, and genre-based interaction
* Hierarchical averaging for missing audience metrics using similar *actor-director-genre* combinations

### 3. Model Development

* Algorithms implemented:
  `Linear Regression`, `Ridge`, `Lasso`, `Random Forest`, `Gradient Boosting`
* Evaluation metrics: **R²**, **RMSE**, **MAE**, and **Cross-Validation RMSE**
* Cross-validation used for robust hyperparameter tuning
* Implementation built on **Scikit-learn** and **NumPy**

## Results and Evaluation

| Model                 |   Test R²  | RMSE (in $M) | MAE (in $M) |
| :-------------------- | :--------: | :----------: | :---------: |
| Gradient Boosting     | **0.7639** |   **93.7**   |   **45.1**  |
| Random Forest (Tuned) |   0.7412   |     98.1     |     45.0    |
| Ridge Regression      |   0.7262   |     100.9    |     51.3    |
| Lasso Regression      |   0.7262   |     100.8    |     51.4    |
| Linear Regression     |   0.7262   |     100.8    |     51.4    |

* **Gradient Boosting** demonstrated superior predictive accuracy, explaining **76.4% of revenue variance.**
* Strongest predictors: **Vote Count (0.773)** and **Budget (0.734)**.
* The residual analysis confirmed robust model generalization and error control.
